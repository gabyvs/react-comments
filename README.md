# React Tutorial

This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## To use

There were several simple server implementations included, but only node was left. It serves static files from `public/` and handle requests to `/api/comments` to fetch or add data. Start a server with:

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
